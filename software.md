The following abandoned software may or may not work for you.  They are 
all unsupported... so proceed with caution!

- [Timezone converter](https://code.launchpad.net/~mwshinn/+junk/timezones) - A
  PHP script which allows you to provide a URL to a specific point in time.  It
  is useful for coordinating across several timezones.  So for instance, input
  "3:00 PM in Chicago", and then this time will be displayed for timezones
  across the world.  This works for time intervals as well, e.g. "3:00-5:00 in
  Chicago".  This was replaced by [worldti.me](https://worldti.me).
- [ForceAtlas2-python](https://launchpad.net/forceatlas2-python) is a
  port of Gephi's [ForceAtlas2 graph layout
  algorithm](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098679)
  to Python (and [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/)). Install
  with "pip install ForceAtlas2".
- [Geneflow](https://code.launchpad.net/~mwshinn/+junk/geneflow) - An
  abandoned research project to study gene fixation in populations
  with more than two sexes.  Written in C++.
- [Notes3](https://code.launchpad.net/~mwshinn/+junk/notes3) is a
  scientific note-taking program based on [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org).
  Now I use org-mode.
- [Notes (Notes1)](https://code.launchpad.net/~mwshinn/+junk/notes) -
  The first version of Notes3, written in Perl using Regexp::Grammars.
- [Scheduler](https://code.launchpad.net/~mwshinn/+junk/scheduler) -
  Display a timetable and/or weekly (recurring) schedule.  Useful for
  undergrads with a fixed timetable.  Written in Haskell.
- [Typeface quiz](https://code.launchpad.net/~mwshinn/+junk/typeface-quiz) -
  An aid in memorizing typefaces.  Quizzes you on different typefaces
  with different texts.  Written in Python/Pygame.
- [Myers](https://code.launchpad.net/~mwshinn/+junk/myers) - An
  abandoned attempt at using different scoring methods to increase
  test-retest reliability to a quasi-Myers-Briggs personality
  inventory.  Written in PHP.
- [Monitor-megabus](https://code.launchpad.net/~mwshinn/+junk/monitor-megabus) -
  Be alerted of cheap Megabus tickets.  Written in Python.

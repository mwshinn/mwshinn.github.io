The Hablator is an advanced GPL'ed chat script written in PHP and
Javascript. It offers all of the features you could want in a chat
script, while maintaining low server requirements, low client
requirements, exceptional speed, and simple installation. In addition,
The Hablator contains some features not found in any other chat scripts
(I am aware of)! If you do not want to read the [blog post I
wrote](http://trombonechamp.wordpress.com/2009/06/28/presenting-the-hablator-rose-0-5-chat-script/),
the most notable non-standard chat features include:

- Translate chat text to communicate with those who speak
  other languages.
- See when others start and stop typing a message
- Upload files easily during discussions
- Allow multiple discussion "topics" to let users discuss different
  things at the same time, and not need to install multiple chat rooms
  and/or prefix each message with the discussion topic. This allows
  users to engage in one or more topics, and follow others they are
  interested in.
- Choose whether to use a FlatFile backend, a MySQL backend, or a
  SQLite backend
- Talk to people who don't have Javascript support, or to people with
  text-only browsers, with compatibility mode

The Hablator is available under the GPL.

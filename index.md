## Neuroscience research

I want to understand computations in the brain: this includes deciphering the
algorithms the brain uses to make sense the world, as well as uncovering the
implementation of those algorithms on neural hardware.  I focus on the
computations involved in vision and decision-making, using clues ranging from
cellular anatomy to high-dimensional activity patterns.  (Technical keywords:
*single cell transcriptomics, electrophysiology, theoretical neuroscience, V1,
generalized drift-diffusion model, resting state fMRI, connectomics*)

[List of publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ytVKRfkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)

Talks available online:

- [The generalized drift diffusion model enables high-throughput screening of perceptual decision-making strategies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7bDWmxixBE)
- [Transient neuronal suppression for exploitation of new sensory evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-H2aCpHcEYw)

I am currently a research fellow with [Kenneth Harris and Matteo
Carandini](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cortexlab/) at UCL.  I did my PhD in neuroscience with [John
Murray](https://johndmurray.org/) and [Daeyeol
Lee](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/daeyeol-lee-lab/) at Yale, my master's
in medical science with [Ed
Bullmore](https://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?etb23) at
Cambridge, and my undergrad in mathematics at the University of Minnesota.


## Scientific software

-   [PyDDM](https://github.com/mwshinn/PyDDM) is a
    simulator for the generalized drift-diffusion model (DDM) in cognitive neuroscience.
-   [spatiotemporal](https://github.com/mwshinn/spatiotemporal) is a Python
    library for modeling spatial and temporal autocorrelation, especially in
    resting state fMRI data.
-   [CanD](https://github.com/mwshinn/CanD) is a Python library for designing complex
    matplotlib layouts and multipanel figures
-   [Paranoid Scientist](https://github.com/mwshinn/paranoidscientist)
    is a runtime verification Python library for scientific software.
-   Find the [versatility](https://github.com/mwshinn/versatility) of a network.
    For more information see [the original
    paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-03394-5).

## Other software

-   [worldti.me](https://worldti.me) provides permanent links to the local time,
    useful for coordinating times across timezones
-   [WriteType](writetype) helps
    elementary school students experience success in writing
-   There are also several [abandoned projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/software).

## Contact

[Email](mailto:max-aht-maxshinnpotential-daht-com)

I extend an open invitation to email me, and I will try to respond promptly.  I
especially love talking to people who use my software, as well as receiving
questions, comments, and constructive criticism about my work.  We can meet in
person if you are in the London area.  (Idea blatantly stolen from [Hillel
Wayne](https://hillelwayne.com/open-invite/) and [Simon
Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Feb/19/office-hours/).)

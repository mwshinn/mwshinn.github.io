## Research

I am interested in using mathematical, statistical, and computational tools to
understand the brain.  I work on spatial and temporal autocorrelation, changing
evidence during decision-making, generalized drift diffusion models,
connectomics, and software verification

I am currently a postdoc with [Kenneth Harris and Matteo
Carandini](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cortexlab/) at UCL.  I did my PhD with [John
Murray](https://johndmurray.org/) and [Daeyeol
Lee](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/daeyeol-lee-lab/) at Yale, and my master's
with [Ed
Bullmore](https://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?etb23) at
Cambridge.

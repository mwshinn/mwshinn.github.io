metadescription: I am a neuroscientist based in London trying to understand how the brain performs computations and processes information.

## Neuroscience research

I study computations in the brain: this includes deciphering the algorithms the
brain uses to make sense the world, and uncovering the implementation of those
algorithms on neural hardware.  I do this by creating new experimental and
statistical techniques to look at single neurons, local circuits, and brain-wide
activity patterns across timescales.

*Technical keywords: spatial transcriptomics, timescales, theoretical neuroscience,
electrophysiology, two-photon imaging, V1, phantom oscillations, generalized
drift-diffusion models, reliable component analysis, coppafish, resting state fMRI, autocorrelation*

Talks available online:

- [The generalized drift diffusion model enables high-throughput screening of perceptual decision-making strategies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7bDWmxixBE)
- [Transient neuronal suppression for exploitation of new sensory evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-H2aCpHcEYw)

I am currently a research fellow working at UCL with [Kenneth Harris and Matteo
Carandini](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cortexlab/).  I did my PhD in neuroscience with [John
Murray](https://johndmurray.org/) and [Daeyeol
Lee](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/daeyeol-lee-lab/), and my master's
in medical science with [Ed
Bullmore](https://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?etb23).


## Scientific software

-   [CASTalign](https://github.com/mwshinn/castalign) registers *in vivo* calcium imaging
    with *ex vivo* brain sections, such as from spatial transcriptomics or
    antibody staining
-   [Reliability Component Analysis
    (RCA)](https://github.com/maxweissenbacher/scikit-rca) finds maximally reliable dimensions using contrastive learning (similar to PCA, but
    maximizing test-retest reliability instead of explained variance)
-   [PyDDM](https://github.com/mwshinn/PyDDM) is a
    simulator for the generalized drift-diffusion model (DDM) in cognitive neuroscience.
-   [Zebra noise](https://github.com/mwshinn/zebra_noise) is a visual stimulus for 
    neuron fingerprinting and mapping neuron visual responses properties
-   [spatiotemporal](https://github.com/mwshinn/spatiotemporal) is a Python
    library for modeling spatial and temporal autocorrelation, especially in
    resting state fMRI data.
-   [CanD](https://github.com/mwshinn/CanD) is a Python library for designing complex
    matplotlib layouts and multipanel figures
-   [Paranoid Scientist](https://github.com/mwshinn/paranoidscientist)
    is a runtime verification Python library for scientific software.
-   Find the [versatility](https://github.com/mwshinn/versatility) of a network.

    paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-03394-5).

## Blog

I do [fun data analyses](http://blog.maxshinnpotential.com) on my blog.
A few posts:

## Music

I compose music, primarily for theatre.  I currently study in the [Book, Music,
Lyrics (BML) program](https://www.bookmusicandlyrics.com/), and previously
studied under [Carol Barnett](https://carolbarnett.net/).  Audio files and
instrumental parts are available upon request.  All music is available under the

## Contact

[Email](mailto:max-aht-maxshinnpotential-daht-com)

I extend an open invitation to email me, and I will try to respond promptly.  I
especially love talking to people who use my software, as well as receiving
questions, comments, and constructive criticism about my work.  We can meet in
person if you are in the London area.  (Idea blatantly stolen from [Hillel
Wayne](https://hillelwayne.com/open-invite/) and [Simon
Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Feb/19/office-hours/).)

## A Creative Commons work for musical theatre

Libretto by Nico Swenson, Score by Max Shinn

### About

*An Empty Box of People* is a new musical in one act. This humerous yet
thought provoking show will leave you with a new appreciation for what
can happen when people become locked in an elevator.

### Synopsis

What happens when six corporate workers suddenly find themselves trapped
in an elevator together? *An Empty Box of People* explores this reality,
while life continues to happen both within the confines of the walls and
in the world around them.

### Casting and orchestration

There are seven roles: two sopranos, a mezzo, an alto, a tenor, a
baritone, and a bass. A recording of a non-acting alto is also needed.

The instrumentation includes Reed (Clarinet, Bass Clarinet, Soprano
Saxophone), Cello, and Piano. (One piece also contains a simple
percussion rhythm to be played by a member of the tech crew.)
